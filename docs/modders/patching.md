# Patching

Patching methods is basically adding your own code on top of a game's method. This is obviously very helpful when you want code to run at a specific time.

### Harmony

?> MelonLoader uses and old version of Harmony, Harmony 1.2, while the documentation is on latest, 2.0.4. Although differences are somewhat minimal.

The library used by MelonLoader for patching methods is called Harmony. Its documentation can be found [here](https://harmony.pardeike.net/). It's recommended to read the page on patching specifically, found [here](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/patching.html) and to read the page on injections, found [here](https://harmony.pardeike.net/articles/patching-injections.html), before consulting the documentation itself.
