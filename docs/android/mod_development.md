# Mod Development
General mod development should be the same as the mainline version of MelonLoader.
Lemon uses .NET 8 instead of 6 for compatibility reasons. If you are compiling mods for both PC and Android, be sure to use PC reference assemblies and .NET 6.
Lemon can load .NET 6 mods as normal, other than for a few small things, such as `BinaryFormatter` being removed in .NET 8.
