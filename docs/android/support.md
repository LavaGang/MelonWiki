## FAQ

> **Q:** Is it ready to use for modding?
>
> **A:** While not all games will work, if MelonLoader doesn't crash during startup, you can mod the game.

> **Q:** Is the port a separate project?
> 
> **A:** Right now the port is on a forked version of MelonLoader. The intention is to eventually merge the fork into MelonLoader.

> **Q:** Is Mono support coming?
> 
> **A:** Supporting Mono games on Android is currently not planned. Unity is phasing out support for Mono on Android. If there is enough demand, this will be reconsidered.

> **Q:** Does the port support the latest MelonLoader features?
> 
> **A:** The main version of MelonLoader is occasionally merged into the port.

> **Q:** Where should I report bugs?
> 
> **A:** The [issues tab](https://github.com/LemonLoader/MelonLoader/issues) of the LemonLoader repo.

> **Q:** Do mods work cross platform?
> 
> **A:** Yes, mods can work cross platform. If the targets of the game are both Il2Cpp, then the process should be smooth. If some versions of the game are Mono and some are Il2Cpp, it may be more difficult to make your mod cross platform. 

> **Q:** Do I need anything special to compile my mod?
> 
> **A:** If referencing Lemon assemblies only, your mod must use .NET 8. If you reference PC assemblies, then you can work as normal under .NET 6.
